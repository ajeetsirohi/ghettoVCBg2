Script to back up VMs in ESXi remotely

Modified original work from William Lam to fit my needs:
1. Backup ESXi host from remote linux server instead of vMA virtual machine.
2. Backup to remote linux server instead of same ESXi host datastore.

Usage:

$ ./ghettoVCBg2.pl
Required command option 'vmlist' not specified.

Credits for this go to William Lam. https://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-9843
